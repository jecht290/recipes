Normal cooking portion would be:
1lb spaghetti
~4-6L water
2tbsp salt(or enough to get water salty)
1 cup cooking water 
(Basically boil water, add salt, add pasta, drain, finish in pan)
Fill a large pot with about 3-4 L cold water and heat up to a rapid boil
In a large nonstick pan, add 2 tbsp olive oil, 2 cloves of eminced(french thingy slice like thin bread) garlic, and ¼ tsp of red chili flakes, but do not turn on the heat, just let the ingredients sit with each other. Make sure to not spread garlic out too much or else it might burn once heat is eventually added
Once the water has come to a boil, add sea salt (1tsp/L water or 2tbsb/lb pasta) to water
Add ½ lb spaghetti to water (rotate the middle of bunch to get them to spread out more evenly and then drop them in) (angel hair, cappellini, or spaghettini is also good for this dish)
Stir pasta a bit to make sure it doesn't stick towards the beginning and as it softens
Let cook undisturbed for 10-11 min allowing rapid boil to keep pasta separated (want to cook for a little less time needed for al-dente because it will continue to cook once we add it to a pan)
Once started cooking pasta, turn pan’s heat to medium and wait until the garlic starts sizzling in the oil and softens a little(~min after beginning to sizzle), then turn heat off pan or take pan off heat
Once pasta should be done cooking, test it out for al-dente, if ready, get ½ cup of pasta liquid reserved for later in recipe and drain out the rest through a colander.
Once pasta is drained, add it to pan and return pan to medium heat, and add reserved pasta water
Toss to combine and add a good pinch of sea salt and tear basil leaves/cilantro over top. 
Continue to toss and cook for a couple of minutes, until there is little to no water left in the pan.
Once done, turn off heat, add the remaining olive oil and gently toss to combine

*how much pasta you make depends on whether it’s a side dish or a main dish and how many people you are feeding. As a rule, make 75-115g/3-4oz of dried pasta per person-about ¼ pound)

*maybe cook up some mushrooms to go with the pasta
